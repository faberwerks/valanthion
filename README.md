<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Valanthion Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://faberwerks.itch.io/valanthion)

<p align="justify">
    <strong>Valanthion</strong> (codenamed <em>Project Swift</em>) is a 2D fantasy action platformer game for Windows. It is set in the original world of Erthair, inspired by Hungarian mythology. The game is available for free on itch.io <a href="https://faberwerks.itch.io/valanthion">here</a>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Valanthion was the first game that Faberwerks began developing. However, the first game that Faberwerks actually finished was <a href="https://faberwerks.itch.io/protectors">Protectors</a>. After numerous details since development began in 2017, Valanthion was finally released on 29 March, 2019. As our first game, Valanthion is definitely not lacking in flaws. However, it represents the ambition and hard work we poured into video game development when we first started out.

<p align="justify">
    Although this repository is primarily for former members of Faberwerks (which has since disbanded) to use so they can come back to study, use this as reference, or just reminisce, anyone who comes across this project is welcome to see the project. However, you may not use any part of this repository for your own purposes without first confirming with us.
